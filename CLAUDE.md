Guidance for Claude Code (and other agents) working in this repository.

## Stack & Conventions

**Hard constraint: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — no frameworks, no build step.**

- No frontend frameworks or libraries (React, Vue, Svelte, jQuery, etc.).
- No CSS frameworks or preprocessors (Tailwind, Sass, Less, Bootstrap, etc.).
- No bundlers, transpilers, or build tooling (Webpack, Vite, Babel, TypeScript, npm scripts that compile anything).
- No package.json-driven build pipeline — pages must run by opening the `.html` file or serving the static files as-is.
- Write plain `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files that run directly in the browser with no compilation step.

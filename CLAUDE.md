# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and other agents) working in this repository.

## Stack & Conventions

**Hard constraint: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — no frameworks, no build step.**

- No frontend frameworks or libraries (React, Vue, Svelte, jQuery, etc.).
- No CSS frameworks or preprocessors (Tailwind, Sass, Less, Bootstrap, etc.).
- No bundlers, transpilers, or build tooling (Webpack, Vite, Babel, TypeScript, npm scripts that compile anything).
- No package.json-driven build pipeline — pages must run by opening the `.html` file or serving the static files as-is.
- Write plain `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files that run directly in the browser with no compilation step.

## Feature Plan

A single-page portal where students browse and use a growing collection of small
learning tools. Home view shows a catalog of tool cards; picking one switches
the page to that tool's view (hash-routed, e.g. `#fuel-system-overview`)
without a page reload. Built to keep growing: adding tool N+1 never touches existing
tools' code.

### Structure

- `index.html` — the one page: header, catalog view (default), one tool view
  container, footer.
- `tools/<tool-id>/` — one folder per tool (its markup fragment, `.js`, `.css`).
- `tools.js` — shared registry: plain array of `{ id, name, description, entry }`
  metadata. Catalog view renders cards by iterating it; tool views mount by id.
- **Adding a tool later**: create its folder, add one entry to `tools.js`,
  and link its `.css`/`.js` files in `index.html` (plain script/link tags —
  no bundler). Each tool calls `TM.registerTool(id, { mount })` at load time;
  the router calls `mount(container)` when its hash is active. No existing
  tool's files change.

### Data model (localStorage, prefixed `tm.*`)

- None currently — no tool stores anything. `storage.js` (the shared helper
  module) was removed with the Quiz Generator; re-add it if a future tool
  needs persisted state, following the `tm.*`-prefixed key convention.

### Visual direction

Bright Lab: white/near-black base, coral accent (`#ff5c6c`), a rotating
pastel tint per card (coral/teal/amber) so new cards keep cycling through
it, pill-shaped buttons and inputs, Fredoka (display) + Karla (body) via
Google Fonts. Full dark-mode token set in `styles.css`.

### Phase 1 — Portal shell + 2 tools (current)

- Shell: header, catalog view, hash-routed tool view, footer, tool registry.
- **Fuel System Overview**: interactive SVG diagram of a jet engine's fuel
  system (adapted from a supplied reference file). Toggle between start and
  shutdown flow states; hover a component for its title and description.
  No stored state — purely explanatory, no localStorage key.
- **Oil System Overview**: interactive SVG diagram of a turbofan oil system
  (adapted from a supplied reference file). Switch spool configuration
  (single/twin/triple), toggle supply/scavenge/return circuits on and off,
  hover a component for its title and description. No stored state.
  Both diagram tools keep their own reference-sheet visual style (not the
  portal's Bright Lab palette) since their colors are semantic — e.g. green
  = open/flowing, red = closed or a return line, amber = active selection.
- Quiz Generator and Flashcard Trainer were both built for Phase 1, then
  removed by request — see git history if either is wanted back. Quiz
  Generator: static Web Basics question bank, scored, saved attempt history
  to `tm.quizAttempts` via `storage.js` (also removed). Flashcard Trainer:
  BYOK Anthropic key, called directly from client JS with the
  `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true` header, no backend.

### Future phases

- Add more tools via the registry pattern above; scope and specifics TBD per
  tool when planned.
